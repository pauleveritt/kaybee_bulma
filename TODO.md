# Now

- Make run_livereload use the core thing

# Next

- Authors, with author info in the sidenav

- Some way to mark whether the parent container is a series

- Break into smaller units of re-usable, overrideable Jinja2 snippets, 
  especially sidenav and listings

- Previous/next doesn't show if not published

# Later

- Links in <head> to get the blog

- Redo sidebar blocks as widgets included via inherited YAML
